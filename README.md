# Deep CNN for Image Classification

This repository contains code for building and training a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

## Getting Started

### Open In Colab

1. **Install Dependencies and Setup**: Clone the repository and configure TensorFlow to use GPU.

2. **Remove Dodgy Images**: Remove images with incorrect file extensions or corrupt files from the dataset.

3. **Load Data**: Load and visualize the image dataset from the directory.

4. **Scale Data**: Normalize the image data for training.

5. **Split Data**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

6. **Build Deep Learning Model**: Construct and compile the CNN model.

7. **Train**: Train the model on the training dataset and validate using the validation set.

8. **Plot Performance**: Plot the training and validation loss and accuracy.

9. **Evaluate**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.

10. **Test**: Test the model with a new image and predict its class.

11. **Save the Model**: Save the trained model for future use.
